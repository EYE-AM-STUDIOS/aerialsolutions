# 🎯 DEPLOYMENT FIX SUMMARY

## Issue Identified
The website https://aerialsolutions.vercel.app/ was showing a blank page due to **merge conflicts** in the `index.html` file that were causing JavaScript errors and preventing the React application from rendering.

## Root Cause
Git merge conflicts in `index.html` contained unresolved conflict markers:
```
<<<<<<< HEAD
// Old code
=======
// New code  
>>>>>>> commit-hash
```

These conflict markers were breaking the JavaScript module imports and causing the entire page to fail to load.

## Resolution Applied

### ✅ Fixed Files:
1. **`index.html`** - Completely cleaned and resolved all merge conflicts
2. **`package.json`** - Verified clean with all Cloudinary scripts intact
3. **`index-clean.html`** - Created as backup/reference

### ✅ Key Changes Made:
- **Removed all git merge conflict markers** (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)
- **Used inline SVG icons** instead of external lucide-react imports (better for Vercel)
- **Preserved full EDIS dual-service branding** (Aerial + Ground-Based Imaging)
- **Maintained all navigation links** (Client Portal, Admin Dashboard, Docs)
- **Kept complete responsive design** and modern UI

### ✅ Deployment Status:
- **Local testing**: ✅ Working on http://localhost:8080
- **Git repository**: ✅ Clean commit pushed to main branch  
- **Vercel deployment**: 🔄 Should be live within 2-3 minutes
