# 🚨 URGENT: Fix Live Site - Construction Worker Image Missing

## The Issue
Your **local version** shows the construction worker image perfectly, but the **live Vercel site** (aerialsolutions.vercel.app) doesn't have it. The live site needs to be updated.

## ✅ Quick Fix - Deploy Updated Version

### Step 1: Login to Vercel
```bash
npx vercel login
# Follow prompts to authenticate with GitHub/email
```

### Step 2: Deploy Updated Site
```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd "D:\GitHub\Repositories\aerialsolutions"

# Deploy to production (this will update the live site)
npx vercel --prod
```

### Step 3: Deployment Prompts
When prompted, answer:
- **Set up and deploy?** → `Y` (Yes)
- **Which scope?** → Select your account  
- **Link to existing project?** → `Y` if you have one, `N` for new
- **Project name?** → `edis-portal` or `aerialsolutions` 
- **Directory?** → `./` (current directory)
- **Override settings?** → `N` (No)

## 🎯 What This Will Fix
After deployment, your live site will have:
- ✅ **Construction worker hero image** (currently missing)
- ✅ **Complete services sections** 
- ✅ **Interactive portfolio**
- ✅ **Working client login**

## 🌐 Alternative: GitHub Integration
If CLI deployment fails:

1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Click "New Project" 
3. Import from GitHub: `EYE-AM-STUDIOS/edis`
4. Configure:
   - **Project Name**: `edis-portal`
   - **Framework**: `Other`
   - **Root Directory**: `./`
5. Click "Deploy"

## ✅ Verification
After deployment, check:
- Live site should show construction worker image in hero
- Navigation should work properly
- Client portal login should function

## 📧 Current Status
- ✅ **Local version**: Perfect with construction worker image
- ❌ **Live version**: Missing construction worker image  
- 🎯 **Solution**: Deploy updated files to Vercel

**The fix is simple - just need to push your working local version to the live site!**
