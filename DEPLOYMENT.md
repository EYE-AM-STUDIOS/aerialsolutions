**EDIS | Enhanced Digital Imaging Solutions - Deployment Guide**

## Quick Deployment to Vercel

### 1. Static Deployment (Current Setup)
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy from your project directory
vercel

# Follow prompts:
# - Set up and deploy? Yes
# - Which scope? (your account)
# - Link to existing project? No
# - Project name: edis
# - Directory: ./
# - Override settings? No
```

### 2. What Works Immediately:
- ✅ Landing page with all service packages
- ✅ Portal login interface (demo mode)
- ✅ Client dashboard (with demo data)
- ✅ Admin dashboard (with demo data)
- ✅ Contact form (via Formspree)
- ✅ All animations and responsive design

### 3. What Needs Backend Implementation:
- ❌ Real user authentication
- ❌ Actual file storage/downloads
- ❌ Database for client/project data
- ❌ Payment processing integration
- ❌ Real progress updates

## Production Implementation Options

### Option A: Keep Static + External Services
- **Authentication**: Auth0, Firebase Auth, or Supabase
- **Storage**: AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Vercel Blob
- **Database**: Supabase, PlanetScale, or Vercel KV
- **Forms**: Keep Formspree (already integrated)

### Option B: Full-Stack Vercel (Next.js)
- Convert to Next.js with API routes
- Use Vercel's database solutions
- Implement server-side authentication
- Use Vercel Blob for file storage

### Option C: Hybrid Approach
- Keep static frontend on Vercel
- Use external backend (Node.js on Railway/Render)
- Connect via API calls

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Deploy Static Version First** (5 minutes)
2. **Set up real authentication** (Supabase recommended)
3. **Implement file storage** (Vercel Blob or AWS S3)
4. **Add database** for client/project management
5. **Integrate payment processing** (Stripe)
